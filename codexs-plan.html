Key Gaps

index.html:85-114 Status row + header pack content edge-to-edge with fixed flex behavior, so the alert message, brand SVG, nav tiles, and AI Liaison CTA fight for space on phones; there’s no wrapping logic or touch-friendly toggle.
index.html:117-219 Primary nav + mega menus are hover-only, absolutely positioned, and wider than the viewport. On touch devices the panels never open, and the horizontal nav scroll is tedious even if it fits.
index.html:180-317 Section grids (.stats, .grid.cols-*, .support-tiles, .logos) only collapse at 1000 px/640 px, leaving phones stuck with 2–3 cramped columns, oversized padding, and centered text that becomes unreadable.
index.html:1052-1236 Hero, metrics ribbon, coverage/map, security callout, and logos all use large fixed padding, two-column layouts, and equal-height cards without mobile overrides, so content overflows or creates very tall gutters.
index.html:1248-1335 Press, testimonials, support tiles, and the upgrade banner share the same desktop card styles; without typography scaling or stacked layouts they look dense and require horizontal scrolling on narrow screens.
index.html:1339-1380 Modal/backdrop and footer grids keep their desktop max-widths; the modal padding + shadows push beyond viewport width and the footer columns don’t stack, forcing zoom.
Implementation Plan

Baseline responsive rules: introduce a mobile-first breakpoint (~480 px) that tightens .container padding, reduces global gaps, and applies clamp() typography to headings/eyebrows so text scales smoothly without manual per-section overrides (index.html:68-90).
Header system: convert the AI Liaison CTA to an icon-only button below 640 px, add a dedicated hamburger (.mobile-menu-toggle) that controls the nav with aria-expanded, and reflow the status row into a stacked message + link layout (index.html:85-114, 502-545).
Navigation/mega menu: hide the desktop mega panels below ~900 px; instead render each primary item as an accordion (details/summary or JS-driven) that expands inline, ensuring keyboard/touch access and preventing absolutely positioned panels from overflowing (index.html:117-219, 502-1048).
Hero + ribbon: reduce hero padding, center-align content, make .row.actions stack, and cap paragraph width; update .stats to 4→2→1 columns with left alignment and flexible padding so metrics remain legible on small screens (index.html:1052-1104).
Card/grids: refactor .grid.cols-*, .support-tiles, .logos, .press-card, and testimonials so they use grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(260px,1fr)) on desktop and automatically drop to single-column on phones; add per-section tweaks (e.g., logos to 3→2→1, testimonials 2→1) to avoid manual overrides all over (index.html:1087-1266).
Coverage/security/map: ensure .coverage, .security, and .map switch to column layouts below ~900 px with consistent spacing, shrink the inline SVG map via aspect-ratio, and adjust .legend to wrap vertically so nothing requires horizontal scrolling (index.html:1170-1236).
Footer + modal: add a breakpoint to stack .footer-grid and center-align CTA links; cap modal width to min(520px, 100vw - 32px) with fluid padding and make the backdrop scrollable on very short viewports so the “Understood” button remains reachable (index.html:1248-1380).
QA & testing: once the CSS/markup changes land, exercise the page in Chrome dev tools at 1200/992/768/480/360 px, verify accordions with keyboard + touch, and rerun a quick accessibility check (e.g., Lighthouse) to ensure focus management and reduced-motion preferences still work.
